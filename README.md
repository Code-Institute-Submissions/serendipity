 # Serendipity Bed & Breakfast



 ## It's a webpage for a Bed & Breakfast called Serendipity.

  - A professional and relaxing impression for a bed & Breakfast to receive more guests.
  - Designed as a guide for Bed and Breakfast owners to use as a template.

## Why this project?
- I wanted to make a site with a personal feel and I've seen so many horrid sites for existing Bed & Breakfast out there. With a more luring site, it would be more appealing for potential guests to book a room.


 ## UX

# First Time Visitor Goals;

1. As a  first time visitor, I want to see the description of what “Serendipity” is on the first page so that I can clearly see that this site is for a Bed & breakfast.
2. As a first time visitor, I want to easily navigate throughout the site for relevant information. 
3. As a first time visitor I want all the buttons and links to take me to the appropriate section.
4. As a first time visitor I want the images to load quickly for convenience.



# Returning/Frequent Visitor goals;
- As a returning visitor I want to quickly see if there is any special offers on that I just can't miss out on.
- As a returning visitor I can easily find the contact information.

# Design:

- My Wireframe was inspired by: 
https://bootstrapmade.com/delicious-free-restaurant-bootstrap-theme/ 


### Color scheme,

- I picked soft colors to make the site feel warm, relaxing and welcoming. Mainly a shade of purple, pink and creamy white. Found the colours on Coolors.

### Typography:

- I chose Lobster for a romantic feel and Lato for the smaller text because the Lobster became difficult to read in smaller text. In case the font isn't being imported into the site correctly I use Sans-serif as a back-up font. (I used letterspacing to make the Lobster easier to read on h4)


### Imagery:
The large background hero images is picked for a relaxing feel. The gallery is supposed to make the potential guest feel like they know what they're buying.

Features:
- Responsive on all device sizes
- Interactive elements


In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes. xxx

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.


# Features Left to Implement for a better user experience:
 - I would like the navbar item to be active on the current page.
 - Adding a marker on the map
 - Get the images better aligned in the gallery.
 - Make the "Christmas Special" look more like a special and not just a static part of the page.
 - The functionality in the form is yet to be implemented. (connect to a database)
 - Come summertime, switch the snowflakes to butterflies.

- https://tinypng.com/  where I optimized and compressed images for a faster page load.


## JQuery
- The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

# Testing:
 - Validator.w3.org
 - Jigsaw.w3.org
 - contrast checker, webaim.org - passed all tests 
 Manually testing the links  xxxxx  different browsers

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

### Contact form:

Go to the "Contact" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

### Navbar:

Try click on all the links, verify the links are highlighted when you hover on them and that you land on the intended page.

### Footer:

All links have a hover effect and when clicked you end up at the appropriate place.



### Buttons:
All buttons have a hover effect and different color when clicked on. Its apparent where it's supposed to go and leads to appropriate page.
