This Bed & Breakfast is make believe. Any mentioned adresses, email addesses or phone numbers are made up for a nicer experience. Serendipity doesn't have any social accounts either, therefore I've linked to the startpages of Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram.

 # Serendipity Bed & Breakfast

 ## This is a webpage for a Bed & Breakfast called Serendipity.
  - Designed to give a professional impression and relaxing feel for a Bed & Breakfast. Goal: receive more guests.
  - Designed as a guide for Bed and Breakfast owners to use as a template.

## Why this project?
- I wanted to make a site with a personal feel and I've seen so many horrid sites for existing Bed & Breakfast out there. With a more luring site, it would be more appealing for potential guests to book a room.


 # UX

## First Time Visitor Goals;

1. As a first time visitor, I want to straight away see that it is a site for a Bed & Breakfast.
2. As a first time visitor, I want to easily navigate throughout the site for relevant information. 
3. As a first time visitor, I want all the buttons and links to take me to the appropriate section.
4. As a first time visitor, I want the images to load quickly for convenience.

# Returning/Frequent Visitor goals;
- As a returning visitor I want to quickly see if there is any special offers on that I shouldn't miss.
- As a returning visitor I can easily find the contact information.

# Design:

### Wireframe

- My Wireframe was inspired by: [Bootstrap theme - Delicious Free](https://bootstrapmade.com/delicious-free-restaurant-bootstrap-theme/ )

### Color scheme,

- I picked soft colors to make the site feel warm, relaxing and welcoming. Mainly a shade of purple, pink and creamy white. Found the colours on Coolors.

### Typography:

- I chose Lobster for a romantic feel and Lato for the smaller text because the Lobster became difficult to read in smaller text. In case the font isn't being imported into the site correctly I use Sans-serif as a back-up font. (I used letterspacing to make the Lobster easier to read on h4)

### Imagery:
The large background hero image is picked for a relaxing feel, like the user is already on a mini break. The gallery is supposed to make the potential guest feel like they know what they're buying.

### Features:

- Responsive on all device sizes
- Interactive elements

### Contact form:

- Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
- Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
