 MSP1-NBN    (Serendipity Bed & Breakfast)

 It's a webpage for a fake Bed & Breakfast called Serendipity.
 Maybe it could work as a template for existing B&B's.

 It's the main source for the B&B to get established and receive more guests. It is designed to be responsible and accessible on a range of devices and make the potential guests feel like they're already on a mini break.
 

UX
First Time Visitor Goals;
- It's clear it's a page for a Bed & breakfast and it should make them want to know more.
- Entering the site, users are greeted with a Hero image and a message. There's also a clean navbar and a couple of       buttons that leads to relevant information.
- It's easy to navigate throughout the site
- The navbar is sticky, the user never lose their way.

Returning Visitor goals;
-Returning  visitor can quickly see if there is a special offer on and get hold of the contact information straight away since you can find it on every page and also a contact link in the navbar.

Design:
Color scheme,
- I picked calm colors to make the site feel warm, relaxing and welcoming. Mainly a shade of purple, pink and creamy white. Found the colours on Coolors.

Typography:
- I chose Lobster for a romantic feel and Lato for the samller text because the Lobster became difficult to read in smaller text. In case the font isn't being imported into the site correctly I use Sans-serif as a back-up font.         

Imagery:
The large background hero images is picked for a relaxing feel. The gallery is supposed to make the potential guest feel like they know what they're buying.

Features:
- Responsive on all device sizes
- Interactive elements
