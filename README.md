Your Project's Name

 It's a webpage for a fake Bed & Breakfast called Serendipity.
 Maybe it could work as a template for existing B&B's.

 It's the main source for the B&B to get established and receive more guests. It is designed to be responsible and accessible on a range of devices and make the potential guests feel like they're already on a mini break.
 

UX
First Time Visitor Goals;
- It should be clear it's a page for a Bed & breakfast and make them want to know more.
- it's easy to move around the pages
-

Returning Visitor goals;
-                                                                                                                       xxxxx

Design:
Color scheme,
- I picked calm colors to make the site feel warm, relaxing and welcoming. Mainly a shade of purple, pink and creamy white. Fpund the colours on Coolors.

Typography:
- I chose Lobster for a romantic feel and Lato for the samller text because the Lobster became difficult to read in smaller text. In case the font isn't being imported into the site correctly I use  xx as a back up     xxxxxx            

Imagery:
The large background hero images is picked for a relaxing feel. The gallery is supposed to make the potential guest feel like they know what they're buying.

Features:
- Responsive on all devices
- Interactive elements

- About
- Gallery
- Rooms
- Booking , Christmas special
- Reviews

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement:

The map on the Contact page is not working, it's atm more of a placeholder map.
The information input in the form doesn't actually go anywhere as of yet when you submit.

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

Testing
 Validator.w3.org
 Jigsaw.w3.org
 contrast checker, webaim.org - passed all tests 
 Manually testing the links  xxxxx  different browsers

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
